                <div id="about">
                    <p>I was born and raised in deep South Texas, I've loved computers for as long as I can remember, with my family telling stories about how I would get on the computer by myself by the age of 3.</p>
                    <p>Software Development became interesting very early in my life because of this I started learning to code on my own and I've loved every second of it.</p>
                    <p>Learning is something I've always loved to do which only grows my passion for Software Development and technology in general as there is always something new to learn in this career</p>
                    <p>Music is also another passion for me for very similar reasons, I've picked up a couple instruments, mainly playing guitar, having played it for a little over 3 years now and there is always something to get better at and always something to learn.</p>
